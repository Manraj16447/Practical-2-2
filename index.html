              The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the defence service force
              of China. PLA was formed in 1972 and it comprises ground forces,
              naval forces, artillery, armed police and air force. Chinese law
              mandates mandatory military service for its citizens and the bulk
              of the force is made of personnel in the age bracket of 18-49
              years. Due to the huge number of volunteers the PLA gets each
              year, it has never had to enforce conscription.

              The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component
              of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme
              Commander of the Indian Army,[4] and its professional head is the
              Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two
              officers have been conferred with the rank of field marshal, a
              five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour.
              The Indian Army originated from the armies of the East India
              Company, which eventually became the British Indian Army, and the
              armies of the princely states, which were merged into the national
              army after independence.

              The U.S. Army is a uniformed service of the United States and is
              part of the Department of the Army, which is one of the three
              military departments of the Department of Defense. The U.S. Army
              is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant, the
              secretary of the Army (SECARMY) and by a chief military officer,
              the chief of staff of the Army (CSA) who is also a member of the
              Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is the largest military branch, and in
              the fiscal year 2020, the projected end strength for the Regular
              Army (USA) was 480,893 soldiers; the Army National Guard (ARNG)
              had 336,129 soldiers and the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) had 188,703
              soldiers; the combined-component strength of the U.S. Army was
              1,005,725 soldiers.

              Before the outbreak of the Korean War, Joseph Stalin equipped the
              KPA with modern tanks, trucks, artillery, and small arms (at the
              time, the South Korean Army had nothing remotely comparable either
              in numbers of troops or equipment). During the opening phases of
              the Korean War in 1950, the KPA quickly drove South Korean forces
              south and captured Seoul, only to lose 70,000 of their
              100,000-strong army in the autumn after U.S. amphibious landings
              at the Battle of Incheon and a subsequent drive to the Yalu River.
              On 4 November, China openly staged a military intervention.
